			<h2>Picking the Right Kitten</h2>
		<p>When picking a kitten it is in your best interest to consider getting a purebred over a mixed breed. Choosing a purebred has it's advantages over choosing a mixed breed because you are more likley to know their personality from from research, rather than sensing what a mixed breed it likely to do growing up. For example, a well-bred Siamese is more likely to be vocal, mischievous, and demanding your attention most the time.</p>
		
<p>Mixed breed cats are wonderful pets as well. They are often beautiful. one of a kind and have distinct personality traits that make them unique. They have mixed traits that are the best of both worlds, such as the raucous meow or your Siamese father and the gorgeous coat of her Persian mother. If you are looking for a unique kitten this is the way to go.</p>

<p>When choosing between male and female, regardless the gender, they are all very cute as kittens. Yet male cats are usually very cozy and friendly, and show trust at an early age. Females are more cautious, but once you earn their trust that are very affectionate.</p>

<p>Things to watch out for when choosing a kitten, is to make sure they are healthy looking. If they have bright, clear eyes, white teeth with no excess tartar, ears clear of thick brown or black wax, smooth nails, and a thick shiny coat, they are most likely healthy. If you spot one of these issues make sure to take them to the vet for care. Remember your helping one more kitten and giving them a great home, these cute little cuddly companions are worth it!</p>

			<h2>Weaning your kitten</h2>
		<p>Kittens have small stomachs(at eight weeks, it's about the size of a walnut), but they do have large appetities and will feed in small amounts often. If you found your kitten without a mother at the age of six to seven weeks, they will still need milk products your can buy at pet value or other pet stores. Ask the store clerk for the best possible product so your kitten gets the right amount of nutrients. When your kitten is about 8 weeks old, you can start to wean her off the milk to soft food and eventually hard kitten food. When weaning your kitten it is important to feed her 3 to 4 times a day at the age of 6-7 weeks old.</p>
		
			<h2>Where, When and How much to Feed</h2>
		<p>When you start feeding your kitten, make sure to place the water and food dish away from the foot of traffic or noise. A place that is comfortable and easy for her to reach is best. Try not to change the location, and make sure the water is clean and fresh at all times. Establishing a routine is very important so your kitten becomes use to a certain time to be fed each day.</p>
		<p> Make sure to use your kittens name when feeding her, and accociating a gentle pet, this will help her become use to a friendly aspect, so she doesn't become aggressive as she gets older.</p>
		<p> If your are feeding your kitten dry food, you can put out the whole days supply in the morning (very convenient if you are a working person). Or you can feed half in the morning and half at night. An advantage of dry food is that it can help keep your kitten's teeth clean and gums healthy.</p>
		<p>For a proper feeding program, try to buy kitten food. You can locate it at any pet store of grocery store usually. Normally the food has extra nutrients and vitamins to keep your kitten's bones strong and healthy. Follow the instructions on the packages for feeding amount.</p>

			<h2>Litter Box Training</h2>
		<p>Litter box training is mostly easy for your kitten. Most kittens naturally feel the urge to dig in substrate material (such as litter box filler) as early as four weeks. When getting your kitten use to the litter box create habits for yourself. Make sure to keep the litter box in a quiet area, keep it clean, remove soiled litter frequently and chance the littler once a week or as needed.</p>
		
<p>As your kitten wakes up or after she eats a meal, place your kitten in the litter box. When she uses it, praise her lavishly and reinforce her great behavior. This creates a positive vibe for using the litter box again.</p>

<p>If you are having trouble with the litter box training and she is leaving "presents" beside the litter box, it may be because of the following reasons. The litter box maybe to dirty, you changed the type of litter, or the location isn't easy enough to access, is there stress near by, did you change their diet? These are all likely to result in her not using her litter box properly. Try playing with her in the morning after she wakes up and at night when you get home from work.</p>

<p>If your kitten lapses in litter box success and for a period of time, it could be somthing more serious. There maybe a urinary tract disorder, which can cause pain, burning and a constant urge to urinate, even when the bladder isn't full. Seek a vet immediately in this serious case.</p>

	<h2>Obedience Training</h2>
		<p>The earlier you teach your kitten obidence in the first year, the easier she will react in a positive way. Once you have chosen your kittens name, call her only by that name until she learns to respond. Unless she is misbehaving talk to her in a gentle calm voice and welcome her to your living area. This creates a comfortable atmosphere for her.</p>
		
<p>When your kitten misbehave's, it's often due to the fact that she is bored and wants to play. In this case if you can't play with her, give her toys as a diversion. A kitten is sensitive to your tone of voice, so in the case of misbehaving, all it takes somtimes is an emphatic "NO!" to get her to stop misbehaving. You can also try clapping your hands to get her attention more quickly.</p>

<p>In most cases, a kitten will have the urge to scratch, it's an instict. Provide your kitten with a scratching post or a cardboard sratching board where she can stretch and scratch her nails. Encourage her to use these items by attaching a toy or rubbing catnip on it. If this tactic by applying lemon-scented furniture polish. This is a sensitive odour that usually is offensive to cats.</p>

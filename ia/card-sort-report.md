## Observations

- Both participants had similar comments about organizing history into one content. 
- They didnt struggle with questions about the article or certain content.
- The groupings were *About Cats*, *how to take care of a cat*, and *feeding a cat*.
- One grouping I thought was kind of neat was the TLC, which stands for tender loving care. It was creative and I went through with using it.
- The results were similar to what I would propose myself because they were basic topics that would have a certain title, such as food brands would be under *feeding your cat*.
- When I was watching them perform the task it was interesting to see what kind of creative titles they used.

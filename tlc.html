			<p>Cats are very well known for being independent and good for cleaning themselves. They spend hours licking their coats because they were made with tongues that have backwards-facing spines about 500 micometers long, which are called papillae. They are rigid, and contain keratin. These spines allow cats to groom themselves, with rows of papillae like a hairbrush. Although some longhaired cats need more assistance. Brushing them regularily helps them from reguritating as many hairballs. Try using a comb or stiff brush and grooming from the head down the body to help them.</p>

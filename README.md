# Cats

Cats are one of the worlds most popular pets among people. They are one of humans best companions to have and learning more about where they came from, their health, and how they act around people is important in discovering if anyone is looking to adopt a new cat or kitten. 

## Purpose

This project is a school project to learn about making design systems for large-scale websites.

Iâ€™m excited to learn about using Git and GitHub in a classroom setting.
